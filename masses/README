This directory provides a script used to perform "mass checks" of an MH mail
spool (mine in particular ;).   It generates summary lines like this:

Y  7 /home/jm/Mail/Sapm/1382 SUBJ_ALL_CAPS,SUPERLONG_LINE,SUBJ_FULL_OF_8BITS

listing the path to the message, its score, and the tests that triggered on
that mail.

Using this info I can figure out which tests get good hits with few false
positives, etc., and re-score the tests to optimise the ratio.

It's generally only interesting if you *really* want to tweak your score
settings, and at the moment it's MH or Maildir-only for now.  But it's
here if you want it ;)
