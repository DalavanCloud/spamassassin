KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

http://bugzilla.spamassassin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=286 :

  Doesn't yet handle checking multiple-attachment messages,
  where one part is qp and another is b64.  Instead the qp will
  be simply stripped.

http://bugzilla.spamassassin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=304 :

  Use of the -S (short-circuit testing) switch is broken:
  the tests matched will not match what would happen without
  -S.


  Razor support does not work on the Win32 platform,
  redirecting stdout and stderr incorrectly.  To work-around,
  set its score to 0 like so:   "score RAZOR2_CHECK 0"
