Bill,
This is the LEAST EXPENSIVE Glenbrook TOWNHOME with LAKEVIEW.  2 years ago it 
would have been listed at $1.8.  My recommendation is make an offer, once I 
see the profile reflecting how much Seller has owing on it.  I will see what 
Seller paid for it in making decision on offer.  Yes, I think this may be the 
better way to go; then you have your NV residence and can trade up.
