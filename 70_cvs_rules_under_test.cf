# this file is a placeholder for rules "under probation",
# ie. checked into CVS for testing.
#
# It should not be distributed; if the rules have good stats
# after a mass-check or two, then fold them into the distributed
# rules files.
#
# I suggest adding a prefix to rules in this file, "T_" -- this
# helps identify probationary rules in test output.
