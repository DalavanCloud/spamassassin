# SpamAssassin rules file: CVS rules under test
#
# This file is a placeholder for rules "under probation", ie. checked into
# CVS for testing. It should not be distributed; if the rules have good
# stats after a mass-check or two, then fold them into the distributed
# rules files.
#
# I suggest adding a prefix to rules in this file, "T_" -- this
# helps identify probationary rules in test output.
