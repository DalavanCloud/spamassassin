Description:  Spam detector and markup engine
 Mail::SpamAssassin is a module to identify spam using several methods
 including text analysis, internet-based realtime blacklists, statistical
 analysis, and internet-based hashing algorithms.
 .
 Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers
 and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited bulk email.
 .
 Once identified, the mail can then be tagged as spam for later filtering
 using the user's own mail user-agent application or at the mail transfer
 agent.
 .
 If you wish to use a command-line filter tool, try the spamassassin
 or spamd/spamc tools provided.
