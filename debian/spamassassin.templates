_Description: Major changes to SpamAssassin mail stream integration
 spamassassin now takes the -P argument by default to act as a pipe
 instead of doing local delivery. If you have been using spamassassin
 (without the -P argument) to do local delivery, you will need to fix
 your mail stream manually. (If you are calling spamassassin via
 procmail, you can probably ignore this.)
 .
 As of 2.40-1, spamproxyd is no longer available. (This was an
 upstream decision.) It appears that spamproxyd is not currently
 running; however, this check may not be totally accurate. If you do
 use spamproxyd, you will need to find an alternative, or download it
 from SpamAssassin CVS.
 .
 You will be given an option to abort the installation.

Default: No
_Description: Delete config files in /etc/spamassassin?
 As of 2.42-1, rules files for spamassassin will be placed in
 /usr/share/spamassassin because of a tighter relationship between
 rule files and the version of spamassassin. You currently have
 configuration files in /etc/spamassassin. Would you like all of these
 out of date configuration files to be deleted? If you don't, you will
 probably need to do this yourself, or you will get many warnings. If
 you do, you may lose some local changes.
