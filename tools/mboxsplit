mboxsplit splits mbox folders into separate files.  If no mbox folders
are specified, standard input is used.

"format" is a string formatted using the sprintf format used by Perl.
It should include a "%d" or other integer directive which will be
replaced by a sequence number (starting with 1 and counting upwards).
The default is "%d".

    exit($status);
