Phrase frequency analysis tools
-------------------------------

This is very similar to the method embodied by the mass-check code in the
'masses' dir.

The spam and nonspam corp{uses,ii} are analysed on the 3 machines (jm's laptop,
dogma, and sonic) where this data is kept.   This is done using 3 shell
scripts, RUNME, RUNME.DOGMA and RUNME.SONIC.  Obviously for your setup you will
have to write your own analyser scripts.

Then, 'join-and-settle-phrases' is used to rsync the output back to one
machine, where it is summarised into a 'spamwords.freqs' file suitable for
distribution as the spam_phrases SpamAssassin rules file.
