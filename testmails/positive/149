Dear Friend:

Hello. My name is Gavin Taylor. I saw this program and thought that this was an 
excellent concept. However, being a Christian and a follower of Jesus, I wanted to 
make sure that this oppurtunity was legal and legit. I am satisfied that it is legal and a 
great way to make a great deal of money. I decided, after reading this oppurtunity, 
that I would start this process over again at a more cost effective price. I want to give 
individuals the oppurtunity to get into this business for very little money down. This 
program usually has a start up fee of $25, that is $5 per person on the list. However, I 
decided that we should run this program for $15, that is $3 per person. The lower the 
cost, the lower your liability. Also, I have a list of reports that you should find 
interesting. As long as you follow the program, and do not get greedy we are going to 
make a great deal of money together. Please read the following information and 
please follow them exactly as it is written. May God bless you in all your financial 
ventures.
________________________________________________________

INSTRUCTIONS:

**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below. (note: Since we are
just starting, my name and address will appear in all the spaces. I
will send out all the reports until we get rolling.)

**** For each report, send $3 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF
THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS
to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

**** When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5
reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $3X 5 = $15.00.

**** Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your
computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's
of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your
computer.

****.IMPORTANT -DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in
any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through
6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not
work if you change it.

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it
will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives
names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it
does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything
other than what is instructed.Because if you do, it will not work for
you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!


__________________________________________________________

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

2.... Move the name & address in REPORT #4down TO REPORT #5.

3.... Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down TO REPORT #4.

4.... Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down TO REPORT #3.

5.... Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down TO REPORT #2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT #1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY!
=================================================

Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save
it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data.
____________________________________________________
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1 : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
============================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it
goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only
a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just
say it is only 0.2% . Also many people will send out hundreds of
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
With a 0.2%response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.
Those 10people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only
0.2% responded with orders. That's = 100 people responded
and ordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000
e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response
to that is 1000 orders for Report #3. Those 1000 people send
out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out.
The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million)e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is
100,000 orders for Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $3 EACH = $300,000.00

Your total income in this example is:
1..... $30+
2..... $300+
3..... $3,000 +
4..... $30,000+
5..... $300,000.........Grand Total = $333,330.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE
OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER
HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF
MONEY!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for
a moment what would happen if everyone, or half or even one 4thof
those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting.
Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!

METHOD #2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===================================================
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads
on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go
along.

For every $3 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report
they ordered. That's it . Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not
advertise until they receive the report.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT #2.
If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until
you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2,
YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for
you , and the cash will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER :Every time your name is
moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different
report.
You can KEEP Track of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAIL SAND
START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to
the income you can generate from this business!!!
