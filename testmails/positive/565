It Works, Its Legal, Its Easy, so Why Not?
Parents of 15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet.
 
Does this headline look familiar?  Of course it does.  You most 
likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major
nightly news program (USA). 
 
His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she
came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously
buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of
her 15-year-old son's closet.  Nothing could have prepared her 
for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it
was full of cash.  Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
 
"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 
41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars 
in that bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year".
 
The woman immediately called her husband at the
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she'd
discovered.  He came home right away and they drove together
to the boy's school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect
that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.
 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the
Internet a type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he
obtained off of the Internet.  Everyday after school for the past 
2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his
bedroom.
 
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put
my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it
out", says the clever 15-year-old. 
 
The E-mail letter listed 3 addresses and contained instructions
to send one $5 dollar bill to the person at the top of the list,
then delete that address and move the other 2 addresses up, and
finally to add your name to the bottom of  the list.  The letter
goes on to state that you would receive several thousand 
dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the
letter with your name at the bottom of the 3-address list "I get
junk E-mail all the time, and  I really didn't think it was gonna
work", the boy continues.
 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post
Office Box that  his parents had gotten him for his video-game
magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines,
but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills.
 
"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office
and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes 
stuffed in it.  There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go
up to the [post office] counter- I thought I was in trouble or
something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter 
and they had a whole box of more mail for me.  I had to ride
back home and empty out my backpack 'cause I couldn't carry
it all".
 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the
E-mail.  "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting
it and stashing it in the closet,  I barely had time for my
homework".  He had also been riding his bike to several of the
area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties
and hundreds.  "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I
kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time
in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank
counter that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the money]
and he was outside waiting for me.  One time the lady gave me
a really strange look and told me that she wouldn't be able to
do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but
I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."
 
Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid.  The
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called
'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a 
chain-letter at all.  In fact, it was completely legal according to
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341,
or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of
federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money
received.

Every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note
that read, "Please add me to your mailing list".  This simple
note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service
(adding the purchasers name to his mailing list) for a five
dollar fee.
 
Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by
E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply
by following the instructions in this letter-
--------------------------------------------
 
Here are instructions on how to make $10,000 US cash in the
next 2 weeks:

There are 3 addresses listed below.

Send the person at the top of the list a $5 bill wrapped in 2
pieces of paper (to securely hide it), along with a note that
says: "Please add me to your mailing list".
 
Then delete that name, move the other 2 up and put your name
at the bottom. 

Now start sending this ENTIRE e-mail back out to people. 
When 20 people receive it, those 20 people will move your
name up to the middle position and they will each send out 20.
That totals 400 people that will receive this letter with your
name in the middle.

Then, those 400 people will move your name up to the top and
they will each send out 20 E-mails.  That totals 8,000 people
that will receive this E-mail with your name at the top and they
will each send you a $5 bill.  

8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill = $40,000 cash.  That's
if everyone responds to this E-mail, but not everyone will, so
you can expect more realistically to receive about $10,000 cash
$5 bills in your mailbox.  
 
This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any
country, but send only a US CASH $5 bill.
 
The more E-mails you send out, the more cash you will
receive.  If each person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be
1,000,000 people that receive this letter when your name
reaches the top. If only 1% of those people respond, you will
still get $50,000 cash.
 
Here is the list:

1.  A. Swayer
    1750 30th Street #145
     Boulder, CO 80301

2.  Chuck Catto

3  Julie Stumpf

    1385 HWY 35
    Middletown, NJ 07748



---------------------------------------------------------- 
 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. When your name
reaches the top in a few days, you will start receiving $5 bills
from other people just like yourself, who are willing to invest a
$5 bill to receive $10,000 cash.
 
To get started quickly, send this to your friends and make a pact that each of you will send X number per week for a certain period of time.  That way each of you will not only see how quickly this will work but you will also benefit from the multiplication of each person’s efforts.  Oh- and don’t forget to promise yourselves something fun to do when the money starts rolling in!  It’s a great way to reach your goal quickly!

If you don't try it- you will never know.... This works so well because your only investment is $5 and a stamp- nothing more.  That is what makes the program QUICK and EASY.  Don’t make it difficult- do it today and get ready for great fun!
