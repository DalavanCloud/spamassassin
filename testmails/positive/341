<BR>
Many Americans are now forced with many difficult financial decisions.<BR>
If you are in financial trouble, or you are constantly stressed<BR>
out about money, please read the following.<BR>
<BR>
1.)Keep paying the bills but get further each month.<BR>

   to tell them their check will arrive next month.<BR>
3.)Try to negotiate with each creditor to reduce the payment <BR>
   and interest rate.<BR>
4.)Declare BANKRUPTCY<BR>
5.)Join a Debt Elimination Program.<BR>
<BR>

doesn't DESTROY your credit as Bankruptcies do.<BR>
<BR>

R>
*The payment is about 20% less than your individual payments.<BR>
*Your debt is paid off in 4-5 years, instead of 8-13 years.<BR>
*Creditors hassle the Debt Elimination Company and instead of<BR>
 hassling you.  If the Debt Elimination Company enforces your<BR>
 rights.  It will be illegal for your creditors to call you.<BR>
<BR>
