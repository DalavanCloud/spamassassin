Hi there,

I have reformatted _Underground_ into HTML format, and from there to iSilo
[1] and Plucker [2] formats -- these two are Palm e-book reader apps which
display HTML-like formatting correctly, and generally provide a niftier
reading experience than DOC format.

The result can be viewed online at http://jmason.org/underground/  -- I
haven't made this URL publically-known yet BTW.

Please note that the version there is not the fully-finished version; I
need to work out why the titles are not being printed correctly. It's
mostly done though.

I have modified the original in the following ways:

  - marked up as HTML ;)

  - added title and back/forward links at the top and bottom of the HTML
    pages

  - added a "Notes on the HTML Version" page

None of the text has been modified, except for the "contents" page.  Would
it be possible to make these pages publically available for users looking
for _Underground_ in HTML, Plucker or iSilo formats?

PS: thanks for freeing it up -- I'm looking forward to sitting down with
it and reading it.  BTW, I think I will be buying it on paper anyway, as
it's a much superior reading medium. ;)
