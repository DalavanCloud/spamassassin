It seems there is a company out there that can pull 100% pure drinking 
water from the air!  This is a revolutionary process that can bring 
clean drinking water to the most contaminated water supply areas in the 
world. The WaterStar Air to Water Hydrological System can produce 
100% pure drinking water at a fraction of the cost of  bottled water. 
The system is able to produce five gallons of drinking water every 
24-hour cycle.

As water is generated from the surrounding atmosphere, it passes 
through fail-safe and continuous station filtration systems and is 
collected in a sterile reservoir. The resulting drinking water 
surpasses EPA purity standards and contains no harmful chemicals,
bacteria, pesticides, trace metals or chlorine. While the system is 
generating pure water, the system is also removing harmful dust and 
other particles from the air.  The result could be one of the best new 
products to come around in years with unlimited potential.
                                             
The bottled water industry is growing at a 30% rate each year with
annual sales of bottled and filtered water at 4 billion per year. 
Advanced Medical Technologies Inc. has licensed their new 
WaterStar Air to Water Hydrological System that is due out Q3 2001. 
With the strong interest in the product, we think this is a great 
opportunity to get involved with the stock at this level.

The WaterStar Air to Water Hydrological System could replace the office 
water coolers and take a huge bite out of the bottled water market.  
Because there is limited competition for this product, we think this 
stock has great potential. Pure water is something everybody needs.

Advanced Medical Technologies Inc. is projecting at least 10 million in 
revenues for 2001 with 2 million in bottom line profits.  On February 
28th, 2001, the company announced it has entered into an agreement 
with Consultants American Corporation to launch a worldwide franchise 
program to distribute its WaterStar systems. The stock symbol (ADMD) 
is currently trading around $.30 but has been as high as $2.25.  The 
sudden profitability of the company should generate huge interest in 
the stock.  

How can you go wrong investing in the key to all life -- water?
