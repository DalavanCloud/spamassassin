A recent customer had this to say:
 
"Hello, my name is John Simmers. In 1997, I
owned my own business...however, due to a
slow economy I had to file bankruptcy. 
Creditors reposed, my home, car and most of
my other belongings. Then I was fortunate enough
to find out about the Financial Freedom 
Services Ltd. It has truly changed my life.
Within 2 weeks of ordering your e-book, I was
able to obtain a copy or my credit report, 
remove every negative item, and place over
$5,000 in true, positive credit information 
on my credit file. 
 
It has now been 1 year since I bought this
program and I now have $130,000 in unsecured
credit lines and have recently financed a new
$285,000 home with $0 down and a new $56,000
Lexus.
 
Thank You for sharing your knowledge with me
and allowing me to regain control of my credit
and my life."

		John Simmers
