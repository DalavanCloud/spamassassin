Dear Sir/Madam

We develop high quality flash animation websites
at extremely low prices. I am requesting your permission 
to send you examples of our work. 

Our creativity has been recognized by Macromedia, 
the producers of the Flash program. I believe you will be 
quite impressed!

We specialize in flash introductions, flash websites, ecommerce and database websites.

Again, only with your permission will I send you some samples to look at and our price guide.

Regards,
The Design Team
