HOW TO TURN $6.00 OR £3.00 INTO $6-$60,000.00

READING THIS....COULD....CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
ACTING ON THIS....WILL...CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
IT..IS..CHANGING...MINE!!!


Anyway, the message said the following:

1) Send just $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated below.
2) You then place your own name and address in the bottom of this list
   below at #6.
3) You post the article in at least 200 newsgroups
   (I know of 40,000 and said only about 200)
4) Wait for your mail and watch your $6.00 to turn into $60,000


What is there to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00,right?

Not bad for a $6.00 risk and 6 stamps.  Most of us have spent more than
that on the lottery!!

So HOW & more importantly WHY does this work?

If you follow the directions exactly, then you will start making more money
than you thought possible by doing something so easy!

Suggestion: Read the entire message carefully! (print it out or
download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in!

It`s easy.  It`s legal.  Your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)


IMPORTANT:
This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is
99% no risk - it really works!  If all of the following instructions are
adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.

PLEASE NOTE:
Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in
20 to 60 days.  This program remains successful because of the honesty and
integrity of the participants.  Please continue its success by carefully
adhering to the instructions.

You will now become part of the Mail Order business.
In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it`s a service.
You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists.
Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.
However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary
When compared to the income which is made from people like
you and me asking to be included in that list.

Here are the 4 easy steps to success:
STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on
	each piece of paper
	"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."
	My name is ...... My address is .....

Once added to the list, each person will send you a new component and/or
money making advice to help you along the way.

This advice has been passed down person to person and is very helpful

Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope
(to prevent thievery).

Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them.
You should now have 6 sealed envelopes each containing a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and
address, and a $1.00 bill or £1.00 for UK.

What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!

Check it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they can confirm that it is legal.

Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:

#1) Frank Dorogi
79 Cheltenham PDE,
Cheltenham, South Australia
5014

#2) M Stroub
262 Santa Fe Ave
Shell Beach, CA, USA
93449

#3) C Guerra
10991-30 San Jose Blvd
#258 Jacksonville, FL, USA
32223

#4) J Sebrien
340E Foothill Boulevard
Claremont, CA, USA
91711

#5) C D John
24 Hampton Court Crescent,
East Molesey,
Surrey, KT8 9BA, UK

#6) G Fedoruk
48 Rowland St
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M6P 1M3


Remember to use the correct international postage and post addresses, and the appropriate US and Canadian postage and post
addresses.

STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move
the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR
Name as number 6 on the list.

STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as
close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at
least 200 newsgroups. (Remember there are close to 40,000 groups) All
you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you
make! You won`t get very much unless you post like crazy. :)

This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18
Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws.

Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money,
you can use it again, and again.

PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully
adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of
integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many
others have received will come your way.

NOTE: You should keep every name and address sent to you,
either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you.
This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might
be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill or UK£1.00 coin in dark paper to reduce
the risk
of mail theft.)

So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed,
six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List
Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list
geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will
be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for
only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send
it now, add your own name to the list and you`re in business!


---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------
Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own
posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and
drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select `copy`
from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the
computer`s memory.

Step 2) Open a blank `notepad` file and place your cursor at the top
of the blank page. From the `edit` menu select `paste`. This will
paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name
to the list. Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If
you want to do your postings in different settings, you`ll always
have this file to go back to.

Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for
various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites,
discussions.)

Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new
message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste
from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that
everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a
particular group, click the post message button. You`re done with
your first one! Congratulations...THAT`S IT! All you have to do is
jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of
it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE

MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! BUT
YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** (easy when there are over 40,000)
That`s it! You will begin receiving
money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to
rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If
you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as
the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE
CORRECT.**

Now the WHY part:
Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low
example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now,
each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200
postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each
of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each
make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I
will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn
around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5
replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the
fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with
my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me
$3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200
newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200
newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original
investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the
list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send
out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6
again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you
realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the
internet and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are
now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think
so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no
one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that
happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest
people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are
willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new
users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual
internet.

Why not post more than 200
If you get 15 responses, look at the math
Here is what you will make:
at #6 $15.00
at #5 $225.00
at #4 $3,375.00
at #3 $50,625.00
at #2 $759,375.00
at #1 $11,390,625.00

Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really
Send it to friends by email and snail mail also

Post it to 1,000's of news groups & bulletin boards, enjoy the results &
prosper!!!!

Regards!
