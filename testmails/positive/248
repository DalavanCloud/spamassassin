By "over-large", do you mean the letters are really big, or only
slightly larger? I'm not running Mozilla 0.7, but a nightly
(2001-01-24-04). When I look at the page, the characters appear to be
slightly larger (on the order of 1 or 2 pixels).

I don't know why this is, but I ran into this same issue when
designing my site. Netscape 4.x displays text smaller I guess. Note
that IE also renders the text in the larger size.

When I first looked at the page, it appeared normal. I had to really
look to see the difference. You may notice a big difference, but your
visitors won't.
