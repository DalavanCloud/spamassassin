Hi folks.  I just downloaded the Mozilla 0.7 release onto Win2000 SP1.  
I have noticed one thing that does not seem to display correctly.  If 
you go to

http://www.popularcategories.com/categories/toys.html, 

there is an error displaying results on the right hand side.  This error only 
shows with Mozilla and Netscape 6.  Other browsers, such as older flavors of 
Netscape (pre 6) and IE (all versions) seem to display the dynamically generated
text on the right hand side correctly.  This, and other pages on the site are generated
dynamically using XML and XSL to generate HTML and then send that to the browser.

I suspect this is a bug, so I thought that I would bring this up as it appears to be the
proper place to do so.  If there is a more appropiate place, please advise.

Wally
