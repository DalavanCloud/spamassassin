Subject: The Who's Who of the Internet on CD-ROM   [upbjv]
Sender: jm@dogma.slashnull.org

Now you can target millions of Internet domain name owners with your
marketing campaigns.  Advertise your product or service to an audience
of dot-com professionals with the help of our unique CD-ROM database.

The Ultimate Internet Marketing Tool CD-ROM is now easier to use. There 
are over 7.5 million data records which include contact name or title, 
company name where applicable, address, telephone number and fax number 
when available, .com, .net or .org URL, and email address. Many of the US 
data records also have an SIC code associated with them. SIC stands for 
Standard Industry Classification.

Additionally, there is a master list containing email addresses only from
the above data included absolutely free.  This list is ready for import
into your mail application of choice without prior manipulation and/or
filtering.

Previous versions of this data have been rather complex to use, in some 
cases requiring people to use very powerful computers to access the CD's 
information, so every effort has been made to make this new product 
easy to use in a Windows environment.

Once you receive your CD you can simply place it in your CD drive and
open the files into your spreadsheet, contact management, broadcasting or
database software program. It can easily be opened into MS Excel for
instance.

By ordering this CD before January 27th you can take advantage of the sale 
price of US$699.99 (plus shipping and handling.)
