PowerWhite Teeth Whitening System
A professional strength tooth whitening system that GETS RESULTS.  

Dentists all over the globe dispense identical products that brighten smiles at a cost of $300 - $600. Now you can have the same strength product and achieve dramatic results for a fraction of the cost!

Don't be fooled by toothpaste's that have harsh abrasives and disappointing results. And, unlike other over-the-counter, mail order or web products, PowerWhite is professional strength.  What that means to you is RAPID RESULTS! 

Here's How Teeth Whitening Works 
A whitening gel is placed in a tray that fits over your teeth. As the active ingredient in the gel, carbamide peroxide, is broken down, oxygen enters the enamel and bleaches the colored substances. The structure of the tooth is not changed; only the tooth is made lighter and whiter. Fillings, Crowns, and Bonding will not lighten. 

Why Teeth Get Dark 
There are many causes. The most common include genetics, aging, consumption of staining substances (smoking, coffee, tea, colas), tetracycline (antibiotic) staining, excessive fluoride, and old fillings. Whitening toothpaste can remove stain that is on the outside of the teeth. Dentists call this extrinsic staining. However, whitening toothpaste and professional dental cleanings will not change the color or intrinsic staining of the teeth. That is why tooth whitening (sometimes called tooth bleaching) is so popular.

How Safe is This? 
Dentists have known for years that tray whitening or bleaching is a fast, safe and predictable way to whiten teeth 2-5 shades in a matter of days. 

Most dentists charge between $400 and $600 dollars for this treatment and it is worth it. Chances are you know someone who has whitened their teeth and gotten great results. 
For many people who want white teeth, several hundred dollars is out of their budget. The cost for treatment is so high because dentists have to pay their employees, office rent, lab, expensive equipment payments, the cost of the whitening products and still try to make a profit. 

That's where we come in. We sell directly on the web and that keeps the cost affordable for you. The result is dental office effective whitening at about a 70% savings over dental office pricing.

How Long will It Last? 
For most people, the treatment is long-lasting. Exposure to coffee, smoking, red wines, and some medicine products will gradually darken teeth again over time. After an initial treatment, most people do touch-ups one day about every 3-6 months.

How long will it take and How white will they get? 
PowerWhite is a 20% Carbamide Peroxide as the whitening agent. When wearing the trays Carbamide Peroxide is slowly broken down to Hydrogen Peroxide which whitens the teeth. The 20% gel whitens quickly but can cause temporary sensitivity to temperatures.  You should use PowerWhite for about 10-14 days to achieve maximum whiteness.
