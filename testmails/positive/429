Wednesday, March 21, 2001 - Opening Position Changes

This morning our top pick in the Small Cap growth sector, Junum, Inc.
(JUNM), announced a Web marketing alliance with Homestore.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:
HOMS – see article at Yahoo finance or through our site news). HOMS received
over 8.4 million hits last month on its real-estate buying and rental related websites. We expect more good news from JUNM over the next two weeks and expect the stock to approach the mid -to- high teens sometime in April.
Junum CEO, David Coulter, is also featured on CEOcast
(www.ceocast.com) currently. Go to the ceocast.com to sign in and view the clip. Junum is outperforming all original estimates and we expect
to add to our position on more good news.

Portfolio Trades Today

We are re-positioning our portfolio this morning. We are selling our positions in COF, CSCO and FRE. These will be replaced with Chevron CHV), Homestore.com (HOMS) and Oceaneering Intl. (OII).
