<HTML><FONT  SIZE=3D2 PTSIZE=3D10>Hi! My name is Betty Wilson. I got your =
e-mail address off a post. Please forgive me if I made an error; I'm a two=
-fingered typist. I put this little note together to show people that it's=
 not impossible to lose any amount of weight that you want! I hope you fin=
d this information useful.<BR>
<BR>
I'm married, with 2 boys, ages 14 and 12.<BR>
<BR>
I was getting bigger every year. My weight had hit 264 pounds at age 38. F=
or my height and build, I should have weighed about 175 pounds. That was 8=
9 pounds overweight, clinically obese. My parents were concerned that I wa=
s overweight, and growing larger. Every time I lost weight, I gained even =
more back.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THEN CAME THE CHALLENGE.</B> They said that if I lost weight and got do=
wn to my proper weight, they would give me $5,000. <BR>
<BR>
I wanted that money, but even more I wanted to look better and be healthy.=
 I dieted on and off for 7 months, but got nowhere. I was depressed and di=
sappointed.<BR>
<BR>
The $5,000 wasn't as important anymore, although I certainly wanted it. It=
 was more the overall challenge of overcoming what had become about the ha=
rdest thing I ever had to do. I suddenly realized just how difficult this =
weight problem had really become. <BR>
<BR>
I had researched and tried many weight loss programs during my yo-yo dieti=
ng years. I did Slim Fast, Cyber vision, soup diets, starvation, "exercise=
-and-eat-no-fat," chromium picolinate, metabolic enhancers, and more. You =
name it and I tried it. I lost some pounds with every diet, and then event=
ually gained it back, usually with a few extra pounds. <BR>
<BR>
I almost gave up. Then, I remembered something I heard about from a friend=
 of mine. He was using a product (some kind of special "Asian berry") his =
doctor recommended, that helped him lose a lot of weight, FAST. It had bee=
n kept a secret for years, until now. An American company hooked up with a=
n Asian scientist and brought the secret here. <BR>
<BR>
Hoping it might help curb my eating problem, I called him up to see how th=
e "berry" stuff (called BERRY TRIM PLUS) was working. He said it was worki=
ng "GREAT" for him, as well as for other people using it. It contains BRIN=
DALL BERRIES, and other key nutrients, which the Asian scientists found in=
 very rare plants and herbs. <BR>
<BR>
It sounded too good to be true, but I tried everything else. So one more t=
ime____. I took Berry Trim Plus every morning; it seemed to help me "wake =
up" in the morning. I was hitting the snooze alarm less. I had more energy=
 during the day, and slept better at night. <BR>
<BR>
I really noticed a difference. The more I took it, the better I felt. I wa=
s staying up later, but was more refreshed in the morning. This was a very=
 different experience compared to other diets; this was a very positive th=
ing. <BR>
<BR>
What a feeling of accomplishment!<BR>
<BR>
Yes, folks, you can still eat, and even eat good stuff. If I had to eat ju=
st a salad with no dressing for a meal, I'd GO CRAZY!<BR>
<BR>
My husband, Sal, is shocked! IN 5 MONTHS I LOST 81 POUNDS, AND IT'S STAYIN=
G OFF! (13 months so far.) I got down to 173 pounds.<BR>
<BR>
It was easy. Anyone can do it. Oh, and yes, I did collect the $5,000. We m=
et my parents for a vacation. They were shocked and delighted; they didn't=
 recognize me, even when I stood right next to them. My mom and dad were g=
lad to give me the money. Dad said it was the best investment he ever made=
 and my mom, well, it took a few days for her to pick her jaw up off the f=
loor. <BR>
<BR>
The best reward wasn't the money. It was the reward of being healthy, and =
looking great again. I have changed, I will never be overweight again. Ber=
ry Trim Plus works incredibly.<BR>
<BR>
Well, now I'm the same weight I was in college, wearing denim cutoffs agai=
n. I fit in all my 20 year old clothes that I saved hoping I would fit in =
them again. I still can't believe it happened. <BR>
<BR>
OK, so here comes the big sales pitch, right? Look, if you want to try thi=
s product, <B><U>your life will change after you lose the weight.</B></U> =
Believe me, this is the only thing in all the years that worked for me. Wi=
th all the marketing scams out there, we have to be skeptical. This is not=
 a scam. <B>It really works!</B><BR>
<BR>
Whether you need to take off five pounds or two hundred, this will help yo=
u do it, <B>fast and easy</B>. The company has a money-back guarantee, and=
 they get practically no returns. That says it all, if you ask me. Click o=
n the link below and read other Berry Trim Plus testimonials to check it o=
ut. I can assure you that I would not put my credibility on the line unles=
s everything I have told you here were 100% true.<BR>
