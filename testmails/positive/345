Dear Sir/Madam



We develop high quality flash animation websites

at extremely low prices. I am requesting your permission 

to send you examples of our work. 



One of our Designers was invited to demonstrate his work at the macromedia flash convention. I believe you will be 

quite impressed!



We specialize in flash introductions, flash websites, ecommerce and database websites.



Again, only with your permission will I send you some samples to look at and our price guide.



Regards,

The Design Team
