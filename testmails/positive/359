Two things to note

1. You are asking this question in the wrong newsgroup. This newsgroup 
is for Mozilla (www.mozilla.org) on which Netscape 6 is based and which 
is a complete rewrite from scratch and has nothing to do with Netscape 
4.x. Try http://help.netscape.com/ if you need help for Netscape 4.x.

2. Mozilla displays the webpage correctly so this is a moot point in 
this newsgroup.
