AMAZING ******* 
EARN UP TO $50,000 OR MORE IN JUST 90 DAYS SENDING E-MAIL. This is a mind Blowing Opportunity so please read on don't delete or pass this up ). After reading the following amazing story I felt compelled to share this with anyone interested in spending more time with their families instead of at work. It's an interesting story; so read it all and you'll see what I mean. 

================================================================ 

"Parents of 15-year old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet." ================================================================ 

********* Does this headline look familiar? ********** 
Of course it does! You most likely have seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
The Mother of a 15 year old boy was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old son's closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash; five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag\'85.. that's more than my husband earns in a year". The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she'd discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boy's school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the Internet a type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he got off of the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. 
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I Sent five dollars to four people for the Reports, put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old. The Reports I received for my 20 dollars were fantastic. 
The E-mail letter listed 4 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each of the 4 individuals. These individuals would in turn e-mail me the 4 Reports. Put your name and mailing info in the number one position, move the number two person to position #3 Move the third person to the 4th position. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name in the number one position. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't think it was gonna work", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. 
"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter- I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had another whole box of mail for me. 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me. 
Amazing story! Just think if that was you. How would you be feeling at the moment? I think pretty excited. Amazingly and surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called 'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received, he immediately sent out the report requested. This Report made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (Sending a Report requested) for a five-dollar fee. 
The Reports that you will receive and eventually send out are the power behind the program. They include insider tips and techniques for cost effective promotion. These Reports are very comprehensive and will allow you to build and promote any business product or service on the Internet. 
You have just read about the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following the instructions below.

THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY METHODS OF BUILDING YOUR DOWN LINE: 
METHOD # 1: Sending Bulk E-Mail 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT # 1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of that 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT # 2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that are 1,000 orders for REPORT # 3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. 
The 0.5% response to that are 10,000 orders for REPORT # 4. That's 10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!! 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100, 000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! 

METHOD # 2 - Placing Free Ads On The Internet 
Advertising on the Internet is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 DOWN LINE members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below: 
1st level--your 10 members with $5................................$50 
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)....................$500 
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).................$5,000 
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...............$50,000 
THIS TOTALS............$55,550 
REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing; tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists. 
THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. 
Before you say, "BULL... ", please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. 
YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store or office. 
This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do: 
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below: (you can't sell them if you don't order them). 
* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL AND ADDRESS; YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) and to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report. 
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! 
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports. You will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. 
* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 
2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than as instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. 
a. Look below for the listing of available reports. 
b. After you've ordered the four reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! 
c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. 
d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. 
e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. 
f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. 
Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! 
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter. 
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE!
