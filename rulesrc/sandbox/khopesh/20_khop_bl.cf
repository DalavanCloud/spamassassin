# The DNSBL side of the Manitu iXhash zone, http://www.dnsbl.manitu.net/
# Out-performs PSBL (72.98/0.12 spam/ham to PSBL's 48.69/0.36) at Intra2net:
# http://www.intra2net.com/en/support/antispam/blacklist.php_dnsbl=RCVD_IN_NIX_SPAM.html
# Since this is run by Heise and already decently advertised, I don't anticipate
# problems testing here.  Flagged 'nopublish' to keep it in testing for now.
