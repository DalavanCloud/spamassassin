# I'm using the RCVD_VIA_ prefix to represent regional internet registries
# rather than blocklists' RCVD_IN_ prefix.  It is VERY important that people
# not consider these to be DNS blocklists ... especially given the fact that
# their mass-check stats at http://ruleqa.spamassassin.org/?rule=/RCVD_VIA are
# quite competitive with the DNSBLs, which is more a reflection of our lack of
# foreign ham in the corpora than any real facts.
