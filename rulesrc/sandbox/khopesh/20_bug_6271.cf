# Some tests with respect to what to do about FH_DATE_PAST_20XX in the long term

# I fully expect this to include too many steps, most of which will never
# see hits.  Likely we'll either conclude the single step (96h+) is enough
# or one or two steps beyond it is optimal.  FH_DATE_PAST_20XX's high scores
# (1.536 2.699 2.390 2.564 as of r891460 on 20091216) it certainly seems
# worthwhile to the GA...
