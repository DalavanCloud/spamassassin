# SpamAssassin rules file: body tests
#
# Please don't modify this file as your changes will be overwritten with
# the next update. Use @@LOCAL_RULES_DIR@@/local.cf instead.
# See 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf' for details.
#
# Note: body tests are run with long lines, so be sure to limit the
# size of searches; use /.{0,30}/ instead of /.*/ to avoid huge
# search times.
#
# Note: If you are adding a rule which looks for a phrase in the body
# (as most of them do), please add it to rules/20_phrases.cf instead.
