# Requires the Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::URIDNSBL plugin be loaded.
# Note that this plugin defines a new config setting, 'uridnsbl',
# which lists the zones to look up in advance.  The rules will
# not hit unless each rule has a corresponding 'uridnsbl' line.

# URI-DNSBL lookups can take a *maximum* of this many seconds past the
# normal DNSBL lookups.
