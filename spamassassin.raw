=head1 NAME

spamassassin - extensible email filter used to identify spam

=head1 SYNOPSIS

For backwards compatibility, running "spamassassin" calls the "sa-filter"
program.  You should be able to view the "sa-filter" documentation with
your man(1) program or perldoc(1).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SpamAssassin is an intelligent email filter which uses a diverse range of
tests to identify unsolicited bulk email, more commonly known as "Spam".
These tests are applied to email headers and content to classify email
using advanced statistical methods.  In addition, SpamAssassin has a
modular architecture that allows other technologies to be quickly wielded
against spam and is designed for easy integration into virtually any email
system.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

For ease of access, the SpamAssassin manual has been split up into several
sections:

    spamassassin              SpamAssassin overview (this section)
    Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf  SpamAssassin configuration files
    sa-filter                 front-end filtering script
    sa-learn                  train SpamAssassin's Bayesian classifier
    spamc                     client for spamd (faster than sa-filter)
    spamd                     spamassassin server (faster than sa-filter)

(If you're intending to read these straight through for the first time,
the suggested order will tend to reduce the number of forward references.)

Extensive additional documentation for SpamAssassin is available,
primarily on the SpamAssassin web site and wiki.

You should be able to view SpamAssassin's documentation with your man(1)
program or perldoc(1).
