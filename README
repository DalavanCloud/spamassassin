Welcome to SpamAssassin!
------------------------

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam using text analysis.

Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers
and body text, to identify "spam", or unsolicited commercial email.

Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for later
filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.

The distribution provides a command line tool to perform filtering, along with
Mail::SpamAssassin, a set of perl modules which implement a Mail::Audit plugin,
allowing SpamAssassin to be used in a Mail::Audit filter, or (possibly at some
point) in a spam-protection proxy POP/IMAP server.

SpamAssassin is distributed under Perl's Artistic license.
