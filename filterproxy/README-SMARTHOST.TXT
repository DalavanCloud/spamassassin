This package contains the Net::SMTP::Server::SmartHost module which is based
upon the Net::SMTP::Server::Relay module from MacGyver's Net::SMTP::Server
package (http://www.macgyver.org/software/perl/).

You also need the entire package proper in order to use it.  Once installed,
copy the SmartHost module to where the Server, Client, and Relay modules are
installed.  On a Debian GNU/Linux Woody system, for example, after being
built, they are installed in /usr/local/share/perl/5.6.1/Net/SMTP/Server.

The module is covered by the same license by which Net::SMTP::Server is
covered.

Hopefully, this will be of some use.
