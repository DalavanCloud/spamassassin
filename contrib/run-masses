# This script will run a mass-check against all mbox files in a given
# set of directories.  The expected directory structure is:
#
# spamassassin				SA version to use
# corpus				location of all corpus files
#  run-masses				this script
#  spam					directory of spam
#  ham					directory of ham
#
# By default, the script looks for "spamassassin-head" which on my
# machine is the latest version from SVN.  You can easily change this
# by passing parameters to this script as such:
#
# run-masses ../spamassassin-garun --progress -n
#
# The first parameter is the directory to use for mass-check (if the first
# parameter isn't a directory, ../spamassassin-head will be the default),
# and all other parameters are passed to mass-check itself.
#
# At the end, you will have a ham.log, spam.log, and results.log in the
# corpus directory.
