3.1.9 is a major bug-fix release, including a potential local DoS.  The major
highlights are:

- bug 5480: fix for CVE-2007-2873: a local user symlink-attack DoS
  vulnerability. It only affects systems where spamd is run as root, is used
  with vpopmail or virtual users via the "-v"/"--vpopmail" OR
  "--virtual-config-dir" switch, AND with the "-x"/"--no-user-config AND
  WITHOUT the "-u"/"--username" switch AND with the "-l"/"--allow-tell" switch.
  This is not default on any distro package, and is not a common configuration.
  More details of the vulnerability can be read at
  <http://spamassassin.apache.org/advisories/cve-2007-2873.txt>.

- bug 5353 - meta rule parsing should handle not equal ("!=") syntax.

- set the score for URI_TRUNCATED to 0.001.

- bug 5337: change the start order for Fedora such that spamd starts before the
  MTA.
