3.2.2 is a minor bug-fix release.  Summary of changes:

- bug 5548: Certain mail input can take a long time to scan with 100% CPU
  utilisation, due to backtracking in a rule's regexp. fix

- bugs 5510, 5518, 5529: fix 'make test' when running as root, needed for CPAN

- bug 5419: kill -HUP of pidof spamd causes the ps name to change from spamd
  to perl. fixed

- bug 5535: 'make test' errors in Windows caused by nonportable use of
  getpwuid

- bug 5462: multiple DNS records for a host name should allow use of spamd -H
  for load balancing installs to work

- bugs 5509, 5511: fix network lookup timeouts, where lookups were being lost
  once a timeout was hit; also fix code to match documentation on
  rbl_timeout's scaling and minimum duration of 1 second; and attempt to
  collect already-received DNS responses when the timeout is reached; improve
  related debugging output. Thanks to Mark Martinec

- bugs 5412, 5478, 5522: Fix problems using the spamc -x option with certain
  other options; 'spamc -x -R' always returned 0, instead of the exit code, on
  error.  Bug 5478: in addition, 'spamc -x -e /command' would still run the
  command, even if errors meant that the filtered text would be unavailable,
  which contradicted -x.

- bug 5445: body eval tests defined in user_rules cause ugly 'Subroutine
  _eval_tests_type11_prineg400_set3 redefined' warnings

- bug 5355: add in new entries for RegistrarBoundaries

- bug 5515: libsslspamc.so & libsslspamc.so can not build without -fPIC, but
  we were picking up the wrong CFLAGS to do this.

- bug 5501: zero score for FH_HAS_XID

- bug 5449: allow_user_rules causes sa-compile / Rule2XSBody plugin to emit
  spurious warnings; fix.  also, add a new 'user_conf_parsing_end' plugin
  hook, which is called after the per-user configuration is parsed

- bug 5182: update the sa-learn doc to mention that -u is only usable w/ sql

- bug 5534: fix harmless-but-ugly C compiler warning in sa-compile
