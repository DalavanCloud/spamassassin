3.2.5 is a minor bug-fix release.  Summary of changes:

- bug 5775: newer gpg versions require keys to be cross-certified (backsig).  Did a cross-verify on our sa-update public key and re-exported.  (If you are already seeing "GPG validation failed" errors from sa-update, see http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/SaUpdateKeyNotCrossCertified .)

- bug 5899: add perl version string to the storage area for compiled rulesets, to avoid crashes when perl is upgraded between major versions (e.g perl 5.8.x to 5.10.0) and the ABI breaks

- bug 5496, bug 5910: clear some FORGED_MUA_OUTLOOK false positives, particularly on the new-format Message-ID generated by the Outlook Express version used in Windows XP service pack 3

- bug 5730: when using Postgres >= 8.1.0 with Bayes, this error occurs: 'WARNING:  nonstandard use of \ in a string literal at character'.  fix, thanks to Tomasz Ostrowski

- bug 5769: fix 'sa-compile: eval failed: Can't find label NO' error, caused  in rare circumstances when sa-compile attempted to deal with rules written using 'replace_rules' features

- bug 5858: fix circular reference memory leak caused by some messages

- bug 5815: update 2TLD list to include .rs CCTLD

- bug 4706: remove HG_HORMOME rules due to poor performance

- bug 5835: typo in POD docs for SPF plugin; thanks to Benny Pedersen for fix

- bug 5839: a missing or failed eval rule function could mistakenly count as a rule hit, fixed

- trivial bugfix for the VBounce ruleset: __BOUNCE_FROM_DAEMON incorrectly used + instead of *, so some From addresses were not being recognised as bounce senders
