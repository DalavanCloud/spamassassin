Subject: ANNOUNCE: Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.0 available

Release Notes -- Apache SpamAssassin -- Version 3.4.0

Introduction
------------

This is a major release.  It introduces nearly two years of bug fixes and
features including the Bayes Redis back-end (bug 6879), eDNS changes (bug
6910), Native IPv6 Support, numerous URIBL.pm changes/features and a 
small API change in libspamc (bug 6562) with many other subtle changes.

IPv6 Note: This was tested on an IPv6-only host (works fine except Razor,
using an external DNS recursive server on a dual-stack host).

And SpamAssassin was tested on a Raspberry PI (ARM6, Raspbian / Debian 7.0 
Wheezy, perl 5.14.2) ... yes it's 20 times slower than an i7-960, but all 
tests pass! (all long & network tests, some stress tests need increased 
timing margins).

Overall, this release has been tested in many production-level 
environments for nearly a year.  It is highly recommended and stable.

GPG Verification Procedure
--------------------------
The release files also have a .asc accompanying them.  The file serves
as an external GPG signature for the given release file.  The signing
key is available via the wwwkeys.pgp.net key server, as well as
http://www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin/KEYS

The key information is:

pub   4096R/F7D39814 2009-12-02
       Key fingerprint = D809 9BC7 9E17 D7E4 9BC2  1E31 FDE5 2F40 F7D3 9814
uid                  SpamAssassin Project Management Committee <private@spamassassin.apache.org>
uid                  SpamAssassin Signing Key (Code Signing Key, replacement for 1024D/265FA05B) <dev@spamassassin.apache.org>
sub   4096R/7B3265A5 2009-12-02

To verify a release file, download the file with the accompanying .asc file and run the following commands:

  gpg -v --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-key F7D39814
  gpg --verify Mail-SpamAssassin-3.4.0-pre1.tar.bz2.asc
  gpg --fingerprint F7D39814

Then verify that the key matches the signature.

Note that older versions of gnupg may not be able to complete the steps above.
Specifically, GnuPG v1.0.6, 1.0.7 & 1.2.6 failed while v1.4.11 worked flawlessly.

See http://www.apache.org/info/verification.html for more information on verifying Apache releases.

About Apache SpamAssassin
-------------------------

Apache SpamAssassin is a mature, widely-deployed open source project
that serves as a mail filter to identify spam. SpamAssassin uses a
variety of mechanisms including mail header and text analysis, Bayesian
filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases. In
addition, Apache SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows
other technologies to be quickly incorporated as an addition or as a
replacement for existing methods.

Apache SpamAssassin typically runs on a server, classifies and labels
spam before it reaches your mailbox, while allowing other components of
a mail system to act on its results.

Most of the Apache SpamAssassin is written in Perl, with heavily
traversed code paths carefully optimized. Benefits are portability,
robustness and facilitated maintenance. It can run on a wide variety of
POSIX platforms.

The server and the Perl library feels at home on Unix and Linux
platforms, and reportedly also works on MS Windows systems under ActivePerl.
