#  factory (required): a BuildFactory to define how the build is run
#  periodicBuildTime (optional): if set, force a build every N seconds

# buildbot/process/factory.py provides several BuildFactory classes you can
# start with, which implement build processes for common targets (GNU
# autoconf projects, CPAN perl modules, etc). The factory.BuildFactory is the
# base class, and is configured with a series of BuildSteps. When the build
# is run, the appropriate buildslave is told to execute each Step in turn.

# the first BuildStep is typically responsible for obtaining a copy of the
# sources. There are source-obtaining Steps in buildbot/process/step.py for
# CVS, SVN, and others.

# These are the steps, from Sidney, for building under win32
#Building in Windows would use, assuming that the environment is set up
#so that svn, perl, and the Microsoft compiler all work:
#
#  svn up http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/trunk
#  perl Makefile.PL < nul:
#  nmake distclean
#  rmdir /s /q Mail-SpamAssassin* 2> nul:
#  del /f /q Mail-SpamAssassin* 2> nul:
#  perl Makefile.PL < nul:
#  nmake
#  nmake test
#  nmake distcheck
#  nmake disttest < nul:
#
#There is no direct equivalent of rm -rf as you can see. Deleting a
#directory uses a different command than deleting a file. The options I
#use there are only valid in Windows 2K and XP, but it is reasonable to
#require that for the build environment. Notice that even though the
#commands have a "quiet" option they still emit warnings to stderr when
#the file or directory doesn't exist, hence the redirection to nul.
#
#If you really want multiple commands on one line in the first configure
#step, you can, but use '&' instead of ';' for the command separator
#character.
