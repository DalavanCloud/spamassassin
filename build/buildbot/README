If you need to change things, please edit the spamassassin/trunk/build/buildbot
files in svn, then do a "sudo svn update" in /home/buildbot/bots/sa on the zones
box:

    ssh spamassassin.zones.apache.org
    cd /home/buildbot/bots/sa
    sudo svn update

once it's good to go, apply changes:
    
    sudo /etc/init.d/buildbot restart

note that you'll probably have to restart buildbot slaves on the slave
machines.   This is a PITA.
