Subject: ANNOUNCE: SpamAssassin 3.1.0-rc1 release candidate available!

*** THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE ONLY, NOT THE FINAL 3.1.0 RELEASE ***

SpamAssassin 3.1.0-rc1 is released!  SpamAssassin 3.1.0 is a major update.
SpamAssassin is a mail filter which uses advanced statistical and
heuristic tests to identify spam (also known as unsolicited bulk email).

This is a release candidate, and NOT the general availability release (yet.)
We think it's pretty rock solid, however. ;)


Highlights of the release
-------------------------

- Apache preforking algorithm adopted; number of spamd child processes is now
  scaled, according to demand.  This provides better VM behaviour when not
  under peak load.

- added PostgreSQL, MySQL 4.1+, and local SDBM file Bayes storage modules. SQL
  storage is now recommended for Bayes, instead of DB_File. NDBM_File support
  has been dropped due to a major bug in that module.

- detect legitimate SMTP AUTH submission, to avoid false positives on
  Dynablock-style rules.

- new plugins: DomainKeys (off by default), MIMEHeader: a new plugin to perform
  tests against header in internal MIME structure, ReplaceTags: plugin by Felix
  Bauer to support fuzzy text matching, WhiteListSubject: plugin added to
  support user whitelists by Subject header.

- Razor: disable Razor2 support by default per our policy, since the
  service is not free for non-personal use.  It's trivial to reenable.

- DCC: disable DCC for similar reasons, due to new license terms.

- Net::DNS bug: high load caused answer packets to be mixed up and delivered as
  answers to the wrong request, causing false positives.  worked around.

- DNSBL lookups and other DNS operations are now more efficient, by using a
  custom single-socket event-based model instead of Net::DNS.

Summary of major changes since 3.0.x
------------------------------------

- Apache preforking algorithm adopted; number of spamd child processes is now
  scaled, according to demand.  This provides better VM behaviour when not
  under peak load.

- Inclusion of sa-update script which will allow for updates of rules and
  scores in between code releases.

- added PostgreSQL, MySQL 4.1+, and local SDBM file Bayes storage modules. SQL
  storage is now recommended for Bayes, instead of DB_File. NDBM_File support
  has been dropped due to a major bug in that module.

- detect legitimate SMTP AUTH submission, to avoid false positives on
  Dynablock-style rules.

- new Advance Fee Fraud (419 scam) rules.

- removed use of the Storable module, due to several reported hangs on SMP
  Linux machines.

- Converted several rule/engine components into Plugins such as:
  AccessDB, AWL, Pyzor, Razor2, DCC, Bayes AutoLearn Determination, etc.

- new plugins: DomainKeys (off by default), MIMEHeader: a new plugin to perform
  tests against header in internal MIME structure, ReplaceTags: plugin by Felix
  Bauer to support fuzzy text matching, WhiteListSubject: plugin added to
  support user whitelists by Subject header.

- TextCat language guesser moved to a plugin.  (This means "ok_languages"
  is no longer part of the core engine by default.)

- Razor: disable Razor2 support by default per our policy, since the
  service is not free for non-personal use.  It's trivial to reenable.

- DCC: disable DCC for similar reasons, due to new license terms.

- Net::DNS bug: high load caused answer packets to be mixed up and delivered as
  answers to the wrong request, causing false positives.  worked around.

- DNSBL lookups and other DNS operations are now more efficient, by using a
  custom single-socket event-based model instead of Net::DNS.

- add support for accreditation services, including Habeas v2.

- better URI parsing -- many evasion tricks now caught.

- URIBL lookups are prioritized based on the location in the message
  the URI was found.

- mass-check now supports reusing realtime DNSBL hit results, and sample-based
  Bayes autolearning emulation, to reduce complexity.

- sa-learn, spamassassin and mass-check now have optional progress bars.

- modify header ordering for DomainKeys compatibility, by placing markup
  headers at the top of the message instead at the bottom of the list.

- spamd/spamc now support remote Bayes training, and reporting spam.

- spamc now supports reading its flags from a configuration file using the -F
  switch, contributed by John Madden.

- added SPF-based whitelisting.

- Polish rules contributed by Radoslaw Stachowiak.
