    Repositories:	https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/spamassassin

    QA:			Snapshot build scripts, run nightly from cron
			[TBM]

			Rule-QA tagging script, run nightly
			[TBM]

			Cron job to combine rsync'd log files and generate
			a rule-QA report text file, visible via HTTP, from that
			[TBM]

    Rsync:		Rsync server to accept rule-QA log files; currently
			holding 2.7Gb of log files, expected to increase
			[TBM]

    Spamtrap:		Spamtrap server, collecting mail from distributed spam
			traps, archiving them, and reporting them to network
			spam-identification services like Razor, Pyzor, DCC,
			and DNSBLs.

			Currently consumes over 1Gbit of bandwidth per day, and
			all the CPU time it's given.  This is not possible to
			run on a shared server due to the load it incurs.
			Suggest this remains outside of the ASF infrastructure.

    [TBM] = to be migrated to apache.org
