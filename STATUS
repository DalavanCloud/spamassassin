WHAT THIS IS:
-------------

This file is based on the Apache httpd project's STATUS file, used to track
outstanding work items in an easy-to-read fast-update format:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/STATUS . The httpd project
use their status file similarly to how we use target milestones in our
bugzilla; in other words to list the current blocker bugs and bug statuses.
We just need to track administrative work items for the project, rather than
for code changes.   By tracking these in this file, it'll be easier to avoid
tasks "falling through the cracks" if one person is busy.
